    title: 'The impact of staying up too late and not maintaining a diet is stroke?!',

    content: 'Staying up late might seem normal, especially for those busy with work, studying, or socializing. However, chronic sleep deprivation has serious impacts on health, including a significantly increased risk of stroke.\n\nStudies show that people who sleep less than six hours a night are twice as likely to experience a stroke compared to those who get enough rest. When the body is sleep-deprived, blood pressure tends to rise, inflammation increases, and blood sugar balance is disrupted — all of which can damage blood vessels and accelerate the development of stroke.\n\nMoreover, staying up late leads to oxidative stress in the brain, worsens heart health, and disrupts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this combination can result in either ischemic stroke (caused by blocked blood flow) or hemorrhagic stroke (caused by bleeding in the brain).\nTherefore, maintaining a healthy sleep pattern — about 7 to 9 hours per night — is crucial to protect brain and heart health and to reduce the risk of stroke early on.',

    title: 'These foods can increase your chances of stroke, avoid them now!!!',

    content: 'Stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. While many factors can contribute to the risk of stroke, one of the most overlooked yet impactful causes is an unhealthy diet. Certain foods, when consumed regularly, can silently increase your risk of developing stroke by affecting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overall heart health.\n\nProcessed foods high in salt are one of the main culprits. Excess sodium raises blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for stroke. Fast food items, packaged snacks, instant noodles, and canned products often contain alarming amounts of salt and preservatives that damage blood vessels over time. Similarly, foods loaded with unhealthy fats—such as fried foods, processed meats like sausages and bacon, and baked goods made with trans fats—can lead to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, restricting blood flow to the brain.\n\nSugar also plays a dangerous role. A diet high in added sugars, commonly found in soft drinks, desserts, and sugary cereals, contributes to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes—conditions closely linked to stroke risk. Furthermore, frequent consumption of red meat and fatty dairy products can increase cholesterol levels and inflammation in the body, making the blood vessels more prone to blockage or rupture.\nIn addition to these foods, heavy alcohol intake can spike blood pressure and weaken blood vessel walls, further increasing the chances of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nTo lower your risk, it\'s essential to adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoiding or limiting harmful foods not only supports better heart and brain function but also significantly reduces the likelihood of stroke in the long term.\n\nYour daily food choices may seem small, but over time, they determine the strength and health of your most vital organs. Make the right choices today — your brain will thank you tomorrow.',

    title: 'Do you smoke? Want to know what the impact is? Read this!',
    source: 'Health Today',
    imageAsset: 'assets/img_article3.png',
    content: 'Smoking may seem like a personal choice or a way to cope with stress, but its impact goes far beyond what many realize. Whether you\'re a light smoker or have been smoking for years, the effects on your body are serious, far-reaching, and often irreversible.\nFirst and foremost, smoking is one of the leading causes of stroke. The harmful chemicals in cigarettes damage the lining of blood vessels, raise blood pressure, reduce oxygen in the blood, and cause blood to clot more easily. This creates the perfect storm for a stroke to occur—either by blocking blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke) or by causing bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Studies show that smokers are up to three times more likely to suffer a stroke than non-smokers.\n\nBut it doesn\'t stop there. Smoking also significantly increases the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and various types of cancer, including those of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder. It accelerates aging, weakens the immune system, reduces lung capacity, and even affects mental health by increasing the risk of anxiety and depression.\n\nFor those who think switching to "light" cigarettes or vaping is safer—think again. These alternatives still contain harmful substances and carry their own health risks, often keeping users addicted and exposed to dangerous chemicals.\n\nThe good news? Quitting smoking, no matter how long you\'ve been doing it, brings immediate and long-term benefits. Within days, your blood pressure begins to drop. Within weeks, your lung function improves. And over time, your risk of stroke and heart disease decreases significantly.\n\nSmoking might offer a moment of relief, but the damage it causes lasts much longer. If you care about your health, your future, and the people around you, there\'s no better time to quit than now. Your body — and your brain — will thank you for it.',
